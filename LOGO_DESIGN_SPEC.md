## Logo Concept: Otter + Lock Guardian

### Visual Description
A modern, flat-design logo featuring a cute otter character in a protective/guarding pose, integrated with a padlock or seal emblem. The otter serves as both a mascot and a functional design element, with the lock representing security and encryption.

### Design Elements

#### Primary Components
1. **The Otter**
   - Stylized, cute but professional appearance
   - Head turned slightly upward/forward in a confident, guardian-like pose
   - Rounded, friendly features (but not overly cartoonish)
   - Eyes should convey trust and competence
   - Small rounded ears characteristic of otters
   - Hint of whiskers or facial features for personality

2. **The Lock/Seal Emblem**
   - Integrated with the otter (not separate)
   - Could be:
     - Held in the otter's paws/arms
     - Part of the otter's body (e.g., shield-like on chest)
     - Merged as a badge or emblem the otter "guards"
   - Lock should have subtle cryptographic elements:
     - Key-shaped shank
     - Subtle geometric patterns suggesting encryption
     - Shield-like outline for security
   - Proportions: Lock should be ~30-40% of total logo size

3. **Secondary Elements**
   - Optional: Subtle background elements (bubble, vault outline, checkmark) to reinforce zero-knowledge/security
   - Keep minimal to avoid clutter

- Should the lock have **visible key** detail or remain minimal?
- Any particular **expression** for the otter? (confident, playful, calm?)
